I've been working extensively with ROS2 Navigation and wanted to share some quick tips that saved me headaches:

1. Always check your TF tree — most navigation failures are TF issues.  
2. Use `rclpy.time.Time().to_msg()` wisely for timestamp consistency.  
3. Depth and laser fusion makes marker navigation far more stable.  
4. Watch for transform extrapolation errors — they silently break navigation.  
5. Keep your marker detection lightweight if using compressed images.  

I'll share more detailed posts soon. Hope this helps someone!
