Welcome to my personal website. I am passionate about robotics, AI, and autonomous systems. My research focuses on combining natural language processing with symbolic planning to enable intelligent, adaptable robot behavior.

Currently, I am pursuing my Master's at RMIT University, building intelligent task planning systems for the Tiago robot platform. I also work with autonomous mobile robots using ROS, computer vision, and AI-driven control.
